# ModerneProgrammierkonzepte
Project by Marcel Mertens, Anton Ochel, Tizian Gro√ü, Tristan Emig & Benno Grimm

## General Idea
* Create a Program that sorts a given Array using Quicksort and then searches for a given Element using Binary Search. 
* Compare that to a Program that searches the Array in a linear matter.
* Find out for which of those programs is more useful for different search operations.

## Concept
* A UI displays all the test results of the different algorithms
* 4 search algorithms and 2 sort & search algorithms can be compared
  * each of the algorithms returns a minimum time, a maximum time and an average time
* every algorithm is tested
  * the test consist of a 10000 element array where one specific number has to be found
    * it is repeated 100 times to get the test results
