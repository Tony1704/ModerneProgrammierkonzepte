# ModerneProgrammierkonzepte
Project by Marcel Mertens, Anton Ochel, Tizian Groß, Tristan Emig & Benno Grimm

## General Idea
* Create a Program that sorts a given Array using Quicksort and then searches for a given Element using Binary Search. 
* Compare that to a Program that searches the Array in a linear matter.
* Find out for which of those programs is more useful for different search operations.
