# ModerneProgrammierkonzepte
Project by Marcel Mertens, Anton Ochel, Tizian Gro√ü, Tristan Emig & Benno Grimm

## General Idea
* Create a Program that sorts a given Array using Quicksort and then searches for a given Element using Binary Search. 
* Compare that to a Program that searches the Array in a linear matter.
* Find out for which of those programs is more useful for different search operations.

## Concept
* A test user interface that displays all the test results
* 4 search algorithms and 2 sort & search algorithms can be compared
* Each algorithm returns a maximum time, a minimum time and an average time which are pulled from the test
  * In each test, a 10.000 entry array is being searched for 1 number 100 times
* The test can be restartet for more accuracy

## Explanation of the test results
* The explanation of the test results will be in german.
